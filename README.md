## Purpose

This HTML page lets you upload an image and then see it transformed under the complex exponential function. Use the mouse to move the image.

## Where Can I Try It?

You can try the page live [here](https://mattias-wikstrom.github.io/logexp/).

## Examples of how images are transformed
* Horizontal lines become circles.
* Vertical lines become lines which meet at a common point.
* Diagonal lines become spirals.
